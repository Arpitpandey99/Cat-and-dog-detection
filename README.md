# Cat-and-dog-detection

#### This Project is about Detection of Cat or Dog from X-ray Images using the Convolutional Neural Network with the respected Accuracy. In this project I've Created a Convolutional Neural Network From scratch to detect a Cat or a Dog in the Image using Deep Learning Algorithm. 

## Objective
#### In this project I've created a model to detect whether the image is of cat or dog with the help of Convolutional Neural Network and optimise it to get the better accuracy.

## Convolutional Neural Network
#### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), also known as ConvNet, comes under Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that, when compared to other FC-layer networks, has enhanced feeds and an impressive potential to generate power, can detect highly embedded features of objects, particularly location data, and can correctly determine. The in-depth CNN model has a limited number of processing layers that can differentiate different aspects of input data (example, picture) using multiple output levels. The first layers identify and create high-level functionalities (with low releases), and the deeper layers create low-level functionalities (with high releases).
